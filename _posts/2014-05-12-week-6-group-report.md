### Overall Status

We are having some issues with the tube, but things are coming together nicely. Week 6 saw a drop in activity due to classes and other responsibilities, but overall things are still progressing at a reasonable rate. Once our tube is in place, collisions and tracking should fall into line nicely.


Group Morale: We're feeling good overall, and ready to kick it into high gear.

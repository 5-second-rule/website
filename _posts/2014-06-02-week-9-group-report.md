### Overall Status

Game is coming along, pieces are being integrated together. We've added lighting to our models and currently integrating it fully to the game. Player select screen has been implemented, making sure each player has a unique character. The adrenaline power up has been integrated into the game, as well as the white blood cell AI. Also, the control scheme has been updated.

The following things still need to be implemented:
- Heads up display
- Dying, Winning
- Start of the racing game intro (3,2,1 countdown)
- Final winning screen which allows you to restart the game
- Red blood cells floating around




### Group Morale

A little bit of hell, but doable..

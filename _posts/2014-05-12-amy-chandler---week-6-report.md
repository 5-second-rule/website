### Concrete goals

 - Create character selection screen with start button, unique character selection

### Goals for next week
 - Unfortunately, I had to miss tonight's group meeting. Before our meeting tomorrow morning, I hope to talk to a couple of group members to discuss the best plan of attack for the week.
 - My (albeit generic) current goal for next week is to help out the group to ensure we're where we planned on being. 
 
### Morale
 - Good, although starting to get anxious about the approaching deadline!

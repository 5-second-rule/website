### Concrete goals
 - Finalize mockups for additional UI screens: tutorial(?)/scores(?)
 - Implement wireframe for gameplay UI
 - Create character selection screen with start button, unique character selection

### Accomplished goals
 - As of yet, I have mostly accomplished research for the UI implementation (as DirectX and 2D objects are both newer to me). By the end of the night, I hope to have both of my goals accomplished:
  - Implement wireframe for gameplay UI
  - Create character selection screen with start button, unique character selection
 
### Problems with meeting goals
 - Inexperience! Though hopefully reconciled tonight. :)

### Goals for next week
 - Unfortunately, I had to miss tonight's group meeting. Before our meeting tomorrow morning, I hope to talk to a couple of group members to discuss the best plan of attack for the week.
 - My (albeit generic) current goal for next week is to help out the group to ensure we're where we want/need to be
 
### Morale
 - Good, although starting to get anxious about the approaching deadline!

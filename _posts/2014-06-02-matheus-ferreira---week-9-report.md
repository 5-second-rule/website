### Goals From Last Week
* Have the management of objects and have autonomous objects bothering the players like crazy.

### Accomplished Goals
* I implemented a AI manager that manage the resources of white and red blood cells for each player. The red blood cells are just a distraction while the white blood cells pursuit the players trying to delay them.
 
### Problems with Meeting Goals
* None but I would like to enhance the AI to make the race more challenging.

### Goals for Next Week
* Try to find the best configuration to the physics and AI
* Finish the game
* Do a reflection

### What is your individual morale (which might be different from the overall group morale)?

Tired but excited with the demo.

### Overall Status

The group is still going strong to meet our Alpha Milestone at the end of Week 4. Things are on track so far, but 
we know how easy it is to slip, so we're working hard to keep eachother focused.

The renderer has an obj loader and has textures being mapped, but a current issue with the texture coordinates is being worked on. 
The engine has made progress and will be integrated this coming week. The network server has been improved to include timeouts, 
waiting for server announce, client heartbeats, and a sample client has been created for testing. An input capture for controls for Win32 
has been implemented and a small sample input handler has been created. The concept art and models continue to look fabulous.

### Group Morale

We're all feeling good. On a scale from 1 to awesome, we feel like a 0x38.

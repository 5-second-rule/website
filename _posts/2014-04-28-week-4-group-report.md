### Overall Status

We have the network integrated into the engine core and the engine core integrated into the client and the server.  The game core now handles events and object updates. However, the integration is not 100%, there are a few battles going on between different parts. Our models are being loaded and texture mapped beautifully, also we have some nice shader effects added to them. The art is also coming along, now moving on to making power ups and intro screens.


Group Morale: We are feeling pretty...and hungry. Mush On.

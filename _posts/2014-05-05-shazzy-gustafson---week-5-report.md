### What were your concrete goals for the week?

* I wanted to finish up another character model ( the white blood cell this week, I wasnt pleased with previous versions of it)
* Finish Ecoli model
* Start on designing 2D versions of the characters
* Decide on a font that will be used on the intro screens

### What goals were you able to accomplish?
* I was able to finish the white blood cell model + texture it
* I created just black and white 2D images of the bacteria
* Found a font that matches the feel of the game


### If there were goals you were unable to meet, what were the reasons?
* Didnt get to texture Ecoli, it is texture mapped but It just needs eyes and a mouth,
just didnt have time

### What are your specific goals for the next week?
* Be done with all character models
* Start working on power ups and weopons

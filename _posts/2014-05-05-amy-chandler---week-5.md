### Problems with meeting goals
 - All goals should be met by the end of tonight, but delays are attributed to the Cinco de Drinko party I was dragged to

### Goals for next week
 - Finalize mockups for additional UI screens: tutorial(?)/scores(?)
 - Implement wireframe for gameplay UI
 - Create character selection screen with start button, unique character selection
 
### Morale
 - Hungry, though mood greatly improved by Shazzy's animation imitation dance
 - Feeling good about the game!

### Overall Status

We're exactly where we want to be. Collisions, track following, bump maps, and
now sound are all working. Our goal for next week is to have the most basic
form of a real game working. We want to be able to win and lose, select
characters, and start a new game. The concrete tasks we need to complete that
are:

 - Game state management
 - Camera Tuning
 - Steering behaviors
 - The White Wall of Death

### Group Morale

We feel mildly char\[\]d. But overall pretty kickass. The game is going great!

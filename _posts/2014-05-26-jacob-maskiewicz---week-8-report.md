### What were your concrete goals for the week?

My plan was to get movement working.

### What goals were you able to accomplish?

Currently rudimentary movement is implemented, but I'd like to have it be a little more robust

### If there were goals you were unable to meet, what were the reasons?

I was depending on having Friday and the weekend to work on 125, however due
to the call for papers deadline for Woot being extended, I had to spend more
time working on my research paper for the Mouse project. That along with grading
for CSE 127 is eating up all of my time, and I'm going to have to spend some
late nights making up for it this week.

### What are your specific goals for the next week?

I'd like to get powerups working.

### What is your individual morale (which might be different from the overall group morale)?

See my unmet goals section. Feeling really stressed out. Just not enough time in the day.

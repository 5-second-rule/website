### What were your concrete goals for the week?

To pass movement and other action events from client to server and update
the object on the server and send the updates to the clients.

### What goals were you able to accomplish?

We have movements, shooting, and other events that are sent from the server. Updates 
are calculated on the server sent back to clients. 

### If there were goals you were unable to meet, what were the reasons?

Some source controls issued cause a slight set back while sorting out but otherwise 
this weeks goals were obtained

### What are your specific goals for the next week?

Further refine the event message passing system and have a working track with multiple clients 
racing down a track.

### What is your individual morale (which might be different from the overall group morale)?

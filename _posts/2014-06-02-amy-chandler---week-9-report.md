### Concrete goals
 - Thoroughly test and refine game state transitions and UI

### Accomplished goals
 - Greatly with the help of Jake, the game state transitions are functioning well and unique character selection is finally synched!
 
### Problems with meeting goals
 - None, though I would have struggled immensely without Jake's help!

### Goals for next week
 - Render a loading screen, possibly a help screen
 - Now that players can die, accurately show death count
 - Make things prettier fullscreen.
 - Not collapse from exhaustion before Friday
 
### Morale
 - Good!
 - Anxious!
 - But good!
 - Can we present next week?! :(

### Accomplished goals
 - Get engine and renderer to a basic working state (partly done)
 - Familiarize myself with DirectX 11 (partly done)
 - Read up on gamma correction
 
### Problems with meeting goals
 - Getting engine and renderer to a basic working state
	- Those of us working on these things seemed to have some scheduling problems this week so we weren't able to sync until the later part of the week. Progress should proceed better next week.
 - DirectX 11 familiarization
	- Aided by helping debug the some of the existing rendering file, but I still feel there is a lot to learn so that is why I am marking that as still incomplete.
	
### Goals for next week
 - Finish getting engine and renderer to basic working state
 - Do as much as I can to contribute to getting basic game up and working

### Concrete goals
 - Implement various game states, including selection, title, gameplay
 - Implement player objects including model selection, death count, and power ups
 - Draw gameplay UI based on player object

### Accomplished goals
 - At the time of writing this this post, I have unfortunately not been able to meet any of my goals this week. 
 
### Problems with meeting goals
 - I was out all weekend for a wedding in PA and got home within the hour of writing this post. I thought I would have more time to get work done than I ultimately actually did, and spent what I could of my nights working on other projects and homework. Planning on yet another long Monday night to get things done.

### Goals for next week
 - Thoroughly test and refine game state transitions and UI
 
### Morale
 - Exhausted.
 - Excited.
 - I love my group.
 - I miss my bed.

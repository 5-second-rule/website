### What were your concrete goals for the week?

The goals for this past week were to have collisions with the wall and other player characters, 
track following for the camera down the tube, character selection and start screen, and sound.

### What goals were you able to accomplish?

All the goals were met except character selection and start screen are still works in progress. 
There is more work to do on sound to support triggered sound effects over the network but sound track is
working.

### If there were goals you were unable to meet, what were the reasons?

The start screen and character selection backend mechanisms are turning out to cause more changes 
to the architecture than orginally expected and have taken longer than predicted.

### What are your specific goals for the next week?

Sound effects and game mechanics in place. Start major play testing to work out kinks and start
to settle on how the game will work.

### What is your individual morale (which might be different from the overall group morale)?

I think morale as a group is good now that we have a lot more coming together

### LE ART UPDATES

After playing around with the different modeling softwares, I created two different models (a white blood cell and an Ecoli). I created the white blood cell in zbrush and exported it to Maya to then be
converted to FBX format to be able load the file. After realizing that the white blood cell model
was giant..... (1 million triangles haha), I had to create a new model. My ecoli model has about 12k triangles which we are now trying to load. Both models also have UV textures created with them also. 
Currently working on other character designs and weapons/power ups

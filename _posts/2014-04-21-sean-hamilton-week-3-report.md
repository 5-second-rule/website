### Concrete Goals

* Client Wait for Announce
* Client Heartbeat
* Server Monitor Heartbeat

### Accomplished Goals
* Sample Client
* Server Announce
* Client Wait for Announce
* Client Heartbeat
* Server Monitor Heartbeat

### Problems with Meeting Goals
Still waiting to be able to drop CSE110 and some work schedule conflicts
	
### Goals for Next Week
* Refactor `CommsProcessor` into `CommsProcBase` class, `ServerCommsProc` and `ClientCommsProc` sub-classes
* Recieveing Actions from Clients and sending world updates to clients
 
### Morale
Not too bad; I have food, coffee, alcohol, a bed, the internet, and no one is shooting at me.

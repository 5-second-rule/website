### What were your concrete goals for the week?

We planned to have collisions and track following.

### What goals were you able to accomplish?

ALL OF THE ABOVE. BOOYA!

### If there were goals you were unable to meet, what were the reasons?

We got a lot done this week, and I'm super satisfied with where we're at.

### What are your specific goals for the next week?

I'm going to work on the white wall of death. In other words, we need to
calculate when a player falls behind, and kill them accordingly.

### What is your individual morale (which might be different from the overall group morale)?

I've had a great week. Managed to get everything I wanted to work on done,
finished the hard part of my mouse-exploit research (the exploit), had a great
Sun God, and managed to put a lot of time into DEFCON Quals over the weekend.

### Overall Status

We have our demo with one player being controlled through the server. The client send events from the keyboard to the server. The object in the server handles the events, it does the updates and sends back the updates to the client. There is a state machine to handle events and do the updates of its object owner when requested. The objects can also be controlled by an AI module. We will work in collision detection and more than one client in the network. We are also working the animation of the models. The art is also coming along, now moving on to making power ups and intro screens.


Group Morale: We are feeling pretty with the demo.

### I ART, THEREFORE I AM

The 3D models are almost all complete, I had to re do some of them and texture map them. Im building the models in maya and then exporting to zbrush to texture map them. Also working on powerups and intro screen (2D art), which will be used as billboards, and also creating some bump mapping for the
red blood cell.

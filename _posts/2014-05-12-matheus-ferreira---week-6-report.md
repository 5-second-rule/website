### Goals From Last Week
* Create behaviors of blood cells trying to block the players and persecuted projectiles.
* Simulate the objects being dragged by the tube path.

### Accomplished Goals
* The objects can follow a path of points
* Behaviors of follow and pursuit objects are working.
 
### Problems with Meeting Goals
* I still was not able to make the objects follow the direction of the tube just go in direction of points along the way.

### Goals for Next Week
* Make the objects follow the direction of the tube with velocity variable according with their distance from the center.
* Create group behaviors
* Work on input commands from the server prompt to change parameters at run time

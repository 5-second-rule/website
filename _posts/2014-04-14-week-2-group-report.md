### Overall Status

The group is going strong! We're dividing up tasks for our Alpha Milestone at
the end of Week 4. Things are on track so far, but we know how easy it is to
slip, so we're working hard to keep eachother focused.

The renderer is working at it's most basic capacity. The engine structure is
mapped out. The network server can run standalone and pass data to itself. The
concept art is looking fabulous.

### Group Morale

We're all feeling good. On a scale from 1 to awesome, we feel like a 0x37.

### Concrete goals
 - White wall of death (WWOD)
 - Loading variable radius tube (once Kyler has it generating)
 - Make tube flow force based

### Accomplished goals
 - White wall of death (WWOD) {basic implementation, constant (slow) velocity}
 - Make tube flow force based {done}
 
### Problems with meeting goals
 - Loading variable radius tube (once Kyler has it generating), didn't sync with Kyler yet. This should be trivial to do.
 - Waiting to figure out what's changing player-wise for the selection screen, to build off of for the WWOD
	
### Goals for next week
 - Finish white wall of death (WWOD)
 - Merge into selection screen stuff
 - Get game fully working
 
### Morale
 - {tired, still hopeful, still excited}

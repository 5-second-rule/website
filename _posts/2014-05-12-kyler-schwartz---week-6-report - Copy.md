### Goals From Last Week
 - Get the tube generation program working correctly so we can have a track to move the players along.
 - Implement any more animations (like one for the Ecoli model).
 - Get the animation loading working properly with the engine ( this might be done by tonight :D ).

### Accomplished Goals
 - Tube is being generated with texture mapped to it (may need to fine tune tube more).
 - Animation and bump map unfortunately weren't able to make progress on due to 127 project.
 
### Problems with Meeting Goals
 - Tube generation is working, however there are a few spots where the tube's wall is a little corkscrewed. Need to figure out why that is occuring. Also bump mapping ran into a little bit of trouble but I have some ideas to get it to work.
 - Tried different logic for generating the tube which could correct the above problem but the generated tube looked horrible so that was reverted.

### Goals for Next Week
 - Get bump mapping working properly on tube.
 - Get animation for ecoli working.

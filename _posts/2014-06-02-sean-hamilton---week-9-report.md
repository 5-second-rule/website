### What were your concrete goals for the week?

To implement a revised control scheme, tune audio so that sounds are not played to quickly
in row and fade off volume with distance. Fix memory management issues we had.

### What goals were you able to accomplish?

The new control scheme is in place and the memory management was cleaned up as well. The 
audio fade volume by distance is in place but I have not rate limited playing of audio
clips yet. 

### If there were goals you were unable to meet, what were the reasons?

Most were met despite the reports due for CSE237B and CSE244A.

### What are your specific goals for the next week?

None for next week but by the end of this week I want to have all audio portion in place,
fine tuned the control scheme, and characters dying and a winner being determined.

### What is your individual morale (which might be different from the overall group morale)?

It is crunch time... I feel god still but I feel like there might be a couple late nights
this in my future

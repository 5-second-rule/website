### What were your concrete goals for the week?

* Create state machines
* Implement AI steering behaviors
* Work on Physics

### What goals were you able to accomplish?

* Create state machines
I implemented a state machine to moving object with three states: stop, move and break. In the demo it was implemented the move state that handles action events of move.


* AI steering behaviors
It was implemented behaviors of seek, flee, arrive, pursuit, evade and wander. We applied the behavior of wander in the demo that makes the player walk alone around the space.

* Physics
I inserted in the simulations a friction force to make movements smoother.

### What are your specific goals for the next week?

I will work on more events and obstacles of blood cells trying to catch the players and persecuted projectiles. I will also work more in the physics, simulating the objects being dragged by the blood. 

### Morale?

Feeling awesome.

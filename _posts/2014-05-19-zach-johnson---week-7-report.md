### Concrete goals
 - More getting game up and running
 - Finish collisions with objects and the tube
 - Tune camera following

### Accomplished goals
 - More getting game up and running {mostly, moving objects following}
 - Finish collisions with objects and the tube {Jake took this on}
 - Tune camera following {basic version working}
 
### Problems with meeting goals
 - Not too much really, mostly putting in the time I guess. I feel like I didn't contribute as much this past week 
  but working on making sure I contribute well.
	
### Goals for next week
 - White wall of death (WWOD)
 - Loading variable radius tube (once Kyler has it generating)
 - Make tube flow force based
 
### Morale
 - {tired, still hopeful, still excited}

### What were your concrete goals for the week?

Get sound effects and game mechanics in place. Start major play testing to work out kinks and start
to settle on how the game will work.

### What goals were you able to accomplish?

Sound effects are working and generalized mechanics are in place to easily add more sounds and different 
sound tracks. Still working on selection screen mechanics and starting games. 

### If there were goals you were unable to meet, what were the reasons?

The selection screen and starting the game is taking more time than expected, plus Memorial Day weekend also occurred.
The control mechanics are still being worked so play testing has not occurred yet.

### What are your specific goals for the next week?

Start major play testing to work out kinks and start to settle on how the game will work.

### What is your individual morale (which might be different from the overall group morale)?

Moral is still good but I am feeling crunch time with all my course having things due these next
couple of weeks.

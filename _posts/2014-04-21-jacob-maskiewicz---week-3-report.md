### What were your concrete goals for the week?

We planned to bring the render into a finished state. That is to say that it
would implement the following features:

 - Model Loading
 - Texture Loading
 - Moveable Camera and Objects
 - Generic Input Handling

### What goals were you able to accomplish?

We got them all done! Input still needs a bit of coercing to be perfect, but we
can currently move a textured model around in 3d space using the completely
abstracted interface of the renderer.

### If there were goals you were unable to meet, what were the reasons?

The input layer is not exactly in a perfect state (because Easter), but it
should be all fixed by the end of the night.

### What are your specific goals for the next week?

We want to integrate all the parts. We're going to plug the renderer into the
engine, and plug the engine into the network, and by the end of the week, we'd
like to see two models on the screen controlled by seperate clients, moving in
3d space.

### What is your individual morale (which might be different from the overall group morale)?

I'm feeling good. I've got some of my Research projects picking up this week,
which means I'm getting busy, but it's a good kind of busy; there's always
something to be working on.
